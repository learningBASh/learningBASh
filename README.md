Hi, I’m @learningBASh on GitHub - I’m interested in learning BASh - I’m currently growing my BASh skill - I’m looking to collaborate on /termux-snapshot I find GNU tar malfunctioning which is slowing my progress. When this quite useful task is accomplished I have become a satisfied BASh programmer. - To reach me on GitHub I’m [@learningBASh](https://github.com/learningBASh) and if you have GPG ask for my Proton mail. you can find me on IRC - Pronouns: Him - Fun fact: GNU Tar is intended for use with a casette tape
